Intermix the examples with the explanation for more clarity.

Use slide support for theory and to follow a structured guideline.

## Scene 1

**Good morninggg!** My name is Miquel, I’m a student at ITB, and today I’m here to talk to you about object-oriented programming.

## Scene 2

### What’s Object-Oriented Programming??

It’s a type of programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects, which those objects interact with each other and the world.

## Scene 3

### What is an object?

An object, just like in the real world, has a state/form and a behavior that defines it. In programming, we assign an object’s state and form with variables, and we decide its behavior with functions.

## Scene 4

### How to represent an object?

Before starting to create objects like crazy, you need to know how to represent an object in UML (diagrams) and understand its structure properly.

_Show an example of a UML object._

### Types of UML Relationships

In UML, we have these types of relationships:  
- **Association**: Two or more objects come together to collaborate.  
- **Aggregation**: The object is composed of other objects.  
- **Composition**: A group of objects that depend on each other to exist.  
- **Inheritance**: Objects inherit the state and form of a superclass.

---

These are the object’s variables, and this less-than symbol (`<`) indicates that they are private variables, accessible only by the class.  

These are the **setters**, which we use to assign values to variables. The plus symbol (`+`) indicates that these are public functions, which we can access from outside the class.  

These are the **getters**, which we use to request the value of variables. As mentioned earlier, they are public functions.  

Each object has its own individual setters and getters for its variables.

## Scene 7

### Basic concepts

Before starting to program, we need to understand that when we create an object, what we’re actually doing is creating a kind of mold or blueprint that we’ll follow to create those objects. Each object we create will be called an **instance**.

## Scene 6

### Implementation in C#

Now I’m going to show you how to implement this in C#...  

First, we’ll create a **console project**; this is where we’ll access our object templates to create the instances. Then, we’ll create a **new class** in a new file or a **library project** where we’ll place the object templates.  

The syntax to follow is this: here we find the setters, getters, and variables.
